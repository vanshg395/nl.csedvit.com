                        that lends students with extra money without any interest. This provides them with financial
                        flexibility and with a loan repay time of 30 days and credit limit boost system, you might

                        you? Seems a bit of a stretch? With Dunzo, major cities in India like Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi,
                        Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad have such delivery services. Everyone’s waiting for it to be a
                        nationwide trend. funded by Google, this start-up is making India lazy (but we’re loving it).

                        as in our heads. This is an app that provides users with a platform to experience their home
                        decorations on their smartphones before actually buying the products. This is a great way to get
                        an overview of your home and avoid the crazy colour contrast blunders!

                        Adhara is one of the best start-ups and really works on the need of the hour by aiming to
                        replace regular currency transactions with cryptocurrencies. Not-so-surprisingly, it has got
                        huge funding from ConsenSys, that has a history of investing in crypto-based companies.

                        Pizza. They use automated ovens and self-cleaning robot cutters for this purpose. Just as much
                        as we’ll enjoy the fact that our pizzas are being delivered by a robot, it is a big hit on the
                        employment status of many people. And, don’t forget about the sudden hike in pizza prices!

                and how they are changing the sporting ecosystem of the country: <br><br>

                <strong>Sports365</strong><br><br>
                Founded by Chandra Sekhar Reddy and Aashutosh Chaudari in 2011, Sports365 is all set to transform the
                face of Indian sports. Sports365 is India’s first professional company that caters to the sports and
                fitness sector by being a one stop solution for sporting requirements of both individuals and
                institutions. <br><br>
                They not only sell a wide range of sports products like sport and fitness equipment, apparels and
                accessories of leading national and international brands, but they also provide services for events,
                infrastructure development, and consulting and merchandising services to schools and colleges,
                corporates, clubs and real estates. <br><br>

                <strong>Xtreme Zone</strong><br><br>
                It was founded by Praveen Krishnaiah and Deepa Praveen. This start-up has been a pioneer in adventure
                sports and is the largest Indian company in this field. They offer paintball, wall climbing, bungee
                jumping from towers and cranes across India, artificial wall climbing etc. <br><br>
                The company provides thrilling sports experiences for the youth by making safe, affordable and quality
                services accessible to them. They also offer exciting outdoor experiences for corporates as well as
                outdoor enthusiasts. <br><br>

                <strong>Protégé Sports</strong><br><br>
                It was founded by Pranesh Krishnamurthy, Rohit Narayan, and Rahul Rane. It was launched with the vision
                to bring sports technology to all. They supply wearable technology for team sports like hockey and
                football which helps to track the players’ performance on the field. This, in turn, enables clubs and
                coaches to set a benchmark for players and manage trial sessions and training accordingly. <br><br>

                It also provides SAAS (software as a service) tools such as software licenses to use its academy/club
                management tools, communication modules and training modules. It also offers tournament management
                services, along with merchandising and ticketing services. <br><br>

                <strong>Fantain Sports</strong><br><br>
                It was founded by Anand Ramachandran, Vivek Venugopalan and Aaravind Ramachandra in 2013. Fantain Sports
                is a fan relationship management and analytics start-up. Sports companies use ‘Fan Data’ to increase
                predictability and revenue by using its ‘Fan Data Management Platform’. It collects and analyses ‘Fan
                Data’ from various sources and provides actionable insights to customers. In 2016, Fantain Sports was
                acquired by BookMyShow. <br><br>

                There are a lot of start-ups emerging in this field and people have now started opening their start-ups
                in this industry rather than opening a start-up in the mainstream industries.

                “Exhausting”. <br><br>
                The only reply most of us get for “How was your week?” <br><br>
                Stress can affect people on one level, not only mentally, or on multiple levels such as both physically
                and emotionally. Most people find various coping mechanisms like smoking, illicit drug usage, excessive
                alcohol etc. which might prove to be very unhealthy in the long run. <br><br>
                These issues, if ignored, might lead to serious secondary mental and physical issues like anxiety,
                depression, insomnia, fatigue, headaches and others. <br><br>
                The response is often immediate and uncontrollable. Consistently, high levels of stress can cause people
                to develop serious conditions such as hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic pain, and even suffer from
                heart attacks. <br><br>
                A good therapy can help people identify the wrong coping mechanisms and instead develop a healthy way to
                manage stress. <br><br>
                Now, coming to all the small triggers which lead to that “everyday” tension-
                Did all the bad days at work, quarrels, arguments and the pressure lead to you slamming your phone at
                the wall? <br><br>
                Then you might want these exact things on your desktop to save you a really bad guilt trip and a good
                fortune, maybe.
