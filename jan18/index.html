                        have come just here for that. What is the purpose of an organisation like ours; organise events,
                        teach about start-ups, promote healthy member development etc. I believe all of this can be
                        summed in one word - “perspective”. We can learn a lot from reading books, watching videos, in
                        our classes (ff anyone pays attention there); but perspective is something that comes from
                        tolerance which in turn comes from experience.
                        This cannot be taught. An organisation like ours provides a platform for people of different
                        backgrounds, culture, and above all – different ideologies and opinions. When we work with all
                        these different people, we learn a lot
                        from them, especially how different they are from us. We learn to appreciate difference of
                        opinion. Once we learn that we start listening to people and incorporate their thinking into
                        ours and this is exactly what I expect from
                        our members. To accept people for who and how they are, instead of trying to fit them in your
                        own mould. Gyaan 101.<br></p>

                                with a battery swapping system.<br><br>In a research conducted by the Petroleum
                                Conservation Research, it was found out that transportation contributes to 51% of
                                pollution in India and, 75-80% in urban areas. Also, there
                                are over 600,000 electric rickshaws which use lead-acid batteries and it takes around
                                8-9 hours for each vehicle to get fully charged. The batteries must be replaced twice a
                                year. <br><br>What makes this company special
                                is the fact that they have mastered battery swapping technology – a process where you
                                swap a drained battery with a fully charged one. This may sound simple, but it is a very
                                complex process. Even Tesla has only tested

                                to a 3D model for a bone.<br><br>This technology, referred to as ‘XrayTo3D’ is used in
                                conjugation with a Cloud-based software called ‘Tabplan3D’, to generate a 3D model of
                                bone on a mobile phone using just two X-ray images!
                                This model can be viewed from any angle and can also be used for virtual simulation of

                <strong>HOW MARKETERS TARGET YOUR WALLET</strong><br></h1>

            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">Ever wondered why you just can’t stop yourself from
                buying that 50 percent off imported juice that you don’t even like. Why do you think that it is so hard
                to stick to your shopping list? <br><br>Here are some tactics experts use to get money
                from our pockets.<br><br><strong>How to get people to shop impulsively?</strong><br><br>Customer
                psychologists have researched that over 50 percent of the purchases made are unplanned ones. Sometimes
                the aesthetic of the item and the glossy
                packaging will attract you towards it and voila, your cart is now overflowing with items that are of no
                use to you. Subconsciously, the architecture of the store can impact consumer satisfaction which in turn
                translates to impulsive shopping.<br><br><strong>The Gruen Effect</strong><br><br>In
                the twentieth century, the architect Victor Gruen used light and space to dramatically display the items
                on the display window. He did so to try to grab the attention of the bystanders and researched if that
                would convert them into customers.
                This phenomenon refers to the habits of a shopper who goes into the store with the intention of buying a
                specific item and comes out with multiple items.<br><br><em>“Almost 20% of buying needs are based on
                    logic and needs and the other 80% of shopping decisions are based on emotions.” </em>The
                creative director for Ikea, Richard La Graauw. So, most retailers try and tap into that
                weakness.<br><br>The jobs of such creative directors and marketers are actually very important as they
                decide how the product is going to be placed
                in the store. Apart from that, they analyse data using technology. Most stores have a huge database at
                their fingertips. They look at the path the customers take, the area and items that interest them.
                <br><br><strong>Scent Marketing</strong><br><br>This
                refers to the subconscious marketing that targets your nose to invoke an emotion. Researchers found that
                combining scent with visual marketing strengthens your memory of the product in the long term. We
                associate scents with emotions,
                for example, the scent of lemons, oranges or anything citrus could help your messy store appear clean.
                Customers in scented environments linger longer, perceive the product as better and are willing to pay
                higher prices.<br><br><strong>Personalising the product</strong><br><br>This
                refers to the customisation of the product in order to appeal to more customers. Case in point, Netflix
                uses artificial intelligence to customise every thumbnail for shows. So, each user has a different
                thumbnail that caters to their field
                of interest. For example, if you watch a lot of comedy stand ups chances are that for the thumbnail of a
                serious movie, you will get a thumbnail of a comic. This intrigues the user as the it makes their
                experience more tailored to their
                needs.<br></p>

                is an excerpt of his interview with CSED VIT*.<br><br><strong>Hi Aathif! Where are you from?
                </strong><br>Hi! I am from Vellore.<br><br><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of
                    sustaining a business in Vellore?</strong><br>We
                have started businesses that previously did not exist in Vellore. For example, Heritage. Getting it to
                Vellore was expensive but it was something Vellore had never seen before. We incorporated different
                interiors and expensive stuff which
                gave us first mover advantage. The risk factor was there but we were welcomed gracefully. Same thing
                with fitness. There were gyms in Vellore but no fitness culture. Before heritage there was nothing on
                this road. Now, it’s completely
                different.<br><br><strong>What were your ambitions when you were growing up?</strong><br>I am someone
                who never wanted my father’s money even though I enjoyed it. I always wanted to make my father proud
                however it may be. <br><br><strong>&nbsp;Have you seen a growth in customers since you
                    started?</strong><br>Yes,
                of course. We have had our ups and downs with quality but made corrective actions according to the
                numbers of customers we cater to.<br><br><strong>How did you get the idea of combining a café with a
                    gym? What makes it work?</strong><br>We
                have always been into hospitality, and footfall is very important for every business. If we just opened
                a café the customer would visit once or twice a week but that is not the case with the gym. We needed a
                USP so it was win-win situation
                in our eyes.<br><br>&nbsp;<strong>How do you manage to sustain a business in Vellore with so much
                    competition?</strong><br>There is no competition. There are places like GRT and Fortune but we have
                our own customers. I believe their quality
                is no-where near compared to ours.<br><br>&nbsp;<strong>How does the social environment of Vellore
                    impact your business?</strong><br>We try to balance the student and the family crowd. We wanted both
                crowds. Our quality and menu take care
                of both facets. We regularly consult technical people to make our quality better and
                improve.<br><br><strong>What’s best advice you’ve gotten?</strong><br>When I was leaving for university
                my father told me “the money and property might
                not be around when you are back. The only asset I can give you is education. Also, live your life to the
                fullest”.<br><br><strong>How do you satisfy your customers?</strong><br>By treating them like guests,
                not like customers. <br><br>&nbsp;<strong>What’s the mentality that drives you to want to
                    succeed?</strong><br>I
                am very confident in whatever I do. I consider myself to be clear headed and act as a motivational
                mirror to everybody by giving opportunities to everyone.<br><br><strong>Learning from failure is the key
                    to success. What motivates you to keep working despite the hurdles in the way?</strong><br>My
                instinct and passion.<br><br>*Answers as given to Janhvi Mehta<br></p>
