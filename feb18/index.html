                        <strong>Q:</strong> Describe your experience as a core member. <br>
                        <strong>A:</strong> I was a core member for about a year. Although, I was the only first year
                        during the first
                        cycle and it was after the referral recruitments that other first years joined me in the T&D. I
                        enjoyed the tasks given to me, because I felt special about my work. The 2nd cycle was amazing,
                        as I interacted with more people and being in the OC helped me understand the working of the
                        chapter. The advent of blog and newsletter was an amazing learning experience. Also, being a
                        part OC helped me interact with other people and widened my perspective. <br><br>

                        <strong>Q:</strong> Favourites <br>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Movie/ TV show- DC shows and Marvel movies.
                        Song- Random playlist depending upon the mood.
                        YouTube- Nowadays- No particular creator, depends on YouTube recommendations. Back in school-
                        KSI, WROTESHAW- FIFA videos
                        App- Headspace- It helps me to meditate
                        Meme- Changes every month, but this one cracks me up every time! <br><br>

                        <strong>Q:</strong> Any incident or experience that you’d like to recount? <br>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Oh well, as I mentioned earlier, I was the only core member in the
                        department. I use to hang
                        out with seniors a lot and there was this one time when a first-year approached thinking I’m a
                        2nd year, and I couldn’t control my laughter. It was weird yet somewhat uplifting. <br><br>

                        <strong>Q:</strong> Name 3 random Startups. <br>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Vicara – Human Augmentation <br>

                <strong>PROS AND CONS OF WORKING FOR A STARTUP COMPANY</strong><br></h1>

            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">In today’s world, every job seeker has a list of
                advantages that he/she expects out of a job, keeping in mind that nothing is ideal and there will always
                be a few drawbacks. <br> <br>

                Working for a startup is on the whole a very different experience. It can be both – fruitful and risky.
                It provides a unique growth opportunity and a lot of other perks for whoever considers the option of
                working with a startup as their career choice. But since only one out of every three startups turns out
                to be successful, working for a startup could also be very deadly. <br> <br>
                <strong>THE PROS</strong> <br><br>
                Starting off with the pros of working for a startup company, startups very well know how to pull off a
                favourable work environment. The employees and founders work together which helps one to get to learn
                from the best. One also gets the opportunity to pick his/her own team members. When the startup company
                does well and flourishes, the employees can be proud of their contributions, thus giving them job
                satisfaction. In addition to this, startups provide flexible work hours, shorter work weeks and in some
                cases, the employees also get to work from home. Every employee is recognised for the work he/she does
                because their impact on the success of the organisation is very evident. There is no unnecessary work
                done. Very less time is spent on making decisions and analysing data. <br><br>
                <strong>THE CONS</strong> <br> <br>
                Moving on to the cons, one major drawback is that the salaries are lower with startups than with
                traditional companies or sometimes the employees get no salary at all. This is because the investors
                pump most of the funds they get into operating costs and product development. The workload is very
                heavy. Employees must work around the clock with very few vacations which further leads to stress.
                Startups expect one person to have plenty of duties. The job security and stability is also very poor
                because the startup might just fail one day and there is a very little chance of keeping the job long
                term. <br><br>

                One fact that should be kept in mind is that every startup is different from the other. They have odd
                working hours and different benefits. Learn to be prepared for failure. It’s not that it will happen for
                sure but it’s always good to be cautious and steady. But before starting it is necessary to make sure
                that a proper goal is set and anybody who’s willing to contribute to the growth of the startup must
                passionately work towards it. Something which is a disadvantage for one person might not be a big
                problem for another. Everybody has a different opinion on whether a startup job is worth it or not.

                An average person thinks five or six times before buying something impromptu and half of the time,
                decides against it. Customers, all over the world, are driven by research and influence. You can get
                your friend to buy the florescent yellow mid length dress instead of the black short one or the white
                canvas shoes instead of Nike sneakers all by telling them that they look good in it! <br><br>

                Social media and celebrities, like in any other field of influence, play an important role in
                consumerism too. No one would buy a Salman Khan bracelet if it wasn’t his trademark. Or the Adidas
                Superstar if it hadn’t come such a long way over the internet. If your product has worth, you have
                social media to make it famous and trendy. If you have money, your product doesn’t need worth. Only
                popular celebrities. <br><br>

                <strong>THE SALE</strong> <br><br>
                Sales and discounts are till-date the best techniques to get customers to buy products that they
                wouldn’t normally buy or to get them to buy products in abundance. A high-end brand like Victoria’s
                Secret, whose products cost $50 on a normal day but $15 on Black Friday, would make people take an extra
                step and pinch their pockets. It’s like meeting in the middle. <br><br>

                <strong>THE CUSTOMERS’ SIDE</strong> <br><br>
                There are weird things that make people buy and not buy. A person would sit in your auto or buy crockery
                from you, if they have the inner satisfaction that they bargained well. Or they won’t buy the product if
                they think its too cheap to be true. Like the famous Akbar and Birbal lemonade story, they’ll think
                there’s something wrong with the product too. You probably wouldn’t buy your friend’s perfume that you
                absolutely love until you get it for as cheap as they did. <br><br>

                <strong>PANIC BUYS</strong> <br><br>
                When a customer buys a specific product or too much, many times they do it for emotional or mental
                peace. That one candle with the scent of guest house laundry will be bought a lot by a customer if it
                reminds him of a time and place in his life, if he’s emotionally attached to it. For mental peace, you
                would do excessive shopping on a bad day to make yourself happy (and maybe regret it later). <br> <br>

                Unlike clothing, accessories or cars, the one thing that will never stop selling because its no longer
                cool or in trend, is food. Your college’s food court’s tempting chicken wings or the uncle’s
                mouth-watering gol gappe will keep selling as long as it tastes the exact delicious. <br><br>

                The psychology of a customer is a lot like the psychology of marketing. When you know what they’ll buy,
                you know what to sell!

                CHANEL: A Case Study</h1>

            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">Though it has inspired tonnes of counterfeits,
                Chanel can be
                unarguably regarded as the most iconic brand in history. In 1883, a young girl called Gabrielle
                Chanel came into the world. <br><br>

                <strong>Gabrielle’s early life</strong><br><br>
                Chanel was one of 5 siblings. Due to her parents being either sick or absent for most of her
                childhood, her father decided to send her and 2 of her sisters to a convent. During her time at the
                convent she learned how to sew. At the age of 18 she decided to leave the convent and become the
                seamstress. Along with her career as a seamstress, she spent her nights working as a showgirl with
                her friends. During her time as a showgirl, she got the name the Coco.
                In 1913, she met a man named Arthur who decided to invest in her store called 21 Rue Cambon. She
                advertised the store by dressing up her aunt and her younger sister and sending them around the
                town, with admirers of their outfits visiting the store. <br><br>

                <strong>Ups and Downs</strong> <br><br>
                21 Rue Cambon was not your typical run of the mill store. It was a primitive fashion boutique
                because during those times clothes were tailored to a person’s preferences. But Coco Chanel really
                made the ready-to-wear dresses a trend. At one point, she even had 4000 employees making these
                dresses for her. <br><br>

                In 1930s, Elsa Schiaparelli came into the picture. Her distinction was that she made glamorous
                evening gowns for older women. That was something that was on the flip side of Chanel’s brand. The
                rising competition eventually made her lose a lot of her customers. So eventually she closed the
                atelier leaving 4000 people unemployed. <br><br>
                It was a well known fact that Chanel was an anti-Semite. Something that stemmed from her convent
                school upbringing and the upper echelon social circle that surrounded her. <br><br>

                In 1954, she decided to reopen her atelier. However, due to her anti-Semitic past the Parisians
                ripped her apart for it. Regardless, she found loyal customers in the Americans and the British.
                Although she got hefty investments from the American people, the brand was on a slow decline. <br><br>

                <strong>The Rise</strong> <br><br>
                In 1971, Coco Chanel passed away which made the brand plummet even further. However, during the fashion
                revolution in the 1980s, a young man named Karl Lagerfeld became the creative director of Chanel and
                used his abilities to transform the brand and stick with its eminent characteristics i.e. the Chanel
                tweeds and bring it into the future. A catalyst for the brand’s resurgence was celebrity endorsements.
                He used models and celebrities in every way possible to keep it relevant. Chanel really made a dent in
                the industry at the 2005 The Met exhibition where it really stood out.
                Under Karl Lagerfeld, the brand has made huge strides and made Chanel recognisable from a distance. In
                2017, the brand made 960 crore US Dollars! He has transformed the brand into majestic, opulent and over
                the top power house.

                <strong>PROCESSING</strong> <br><br>
                Male brains utilise nearly seven times more gray matter for activity while female brains utilise nearly
                ten times more white matter. <br><br>

                The gray matter areas of the brain are the information-and-action processing centers of the brain. These
                are localised and are responsible for the translation to a vision which particularly suggests that they
                may not demonstrate sensitivity to others when they are deeply engaged in any kind of task or game.
                <br><br>

                White matter is the networking grid that connects the brain’s gray matter and other processing centers.
                This is probably why you may have noticed that women tend to transition quickly between tasks while men
                excel in highly task-focused projects. Both of these here, explain the title very well. <br><br>

                <strong>CHEMISTRY</strong><br><br>
                Male and female brains process the same neurochemicals but to different degrees. Some of them are
                serotonin, which helps us sit still; testosterone, estrogen and oxytocin, a bonding-relationship
                chemical. <br><br>

                Males process less oxytocin than females which directly suggests that our boys, at times, need different
                strategies for stress release and hence are generally more aggressive. <br><br>

                <strong>STRUCTURE</strong><br><br>
                Females often have a larger human memory center. As a result, girls and women tend to input or absorb
                more sensorial and emotive information than males do and retain them (The exact reason why he forgets
                your birthday!) <br><br>

                Females tend to have verbal centers on both sides of the brain, while males tend to have them only on
                the left hemisphere. This is why girls tend to use more words when describing anything. Hence, when it
                comes to discussing feelings and emotions and senses together, girls are generally more interested.
                <br><br>


                <strong>ACTIVITY</strong><br><br>
                The female brain often ruminates on and revisits emotional memories, unlike the male brain. This is
                partly because of a greater natural blood flow throughout the brain at any given time (more white matter
                processing). <br><br>

                Males first reflect briefly on an emotive memory, analyse it to an extent, and then move onto the next
                task. They may also change course and do something that is active and unrelated to emotions. This is why
                we believe that men avoid their feelings or that they move to problem-solving too soon. <br><br>

                Understanding all these, and more of such gender differences from a neurological perspective not only
                opens the door to greater appreciation of the different genders, it also calls into question how we
                parent, educate, and support our children from a young age.

                "Love him or hate him, but you can't ignore him". Back in 2004, Karan Johar came up with a show called
                <em>Koffee with Karan.</em> The format of the show is very straight - candidness. Actors, or more
                accurately,
                stars come on the show to talk about their personal lives.
                This year, in 2018-19 and the sixth season, for the first time ever, they invited cricketers on the show
                (or the couch as the host likes to call it) – KL Rahul, a flamboyant batsman, the other a good
                all-rounder in Hardik Pandya.

            </div>
            <p class="text-justify" style="color: #ffffff;">
                If you have been following the show, you’d be aware that the makers want to put words in the guests’
                mouths. They want them to say things that would spark controversy and boy, doesn’t the Indian public
                just adore controversy! <br><br>

                Karan Johar is a fantastic host and he is aware of the peculiarities of the show.
                The episode of Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul was like any other Koffee with Karan episodes, where Karan
                would want you to talk about the intricacies of your personal life, sex, women or men, one's fights,
                love, crushes and other topics like these. It all goes very well with the audience because they are used
                to watching the film industry celebs and there is an acceptance among the audience that these things or
                controversial talks go hand in hand with the stars. <br><br>

                Cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and MS Dhoni have built an image that portrays cricketers
                as gentlemen. And then, someone like Pandya absolutely shatters that image. <br><br>


                On the show, Pandya talks about his vibe with his parents. He revealed that he told them about his
                different partners and his physical encounters. KL Rahul revealed that they used other teammates’ rooms
                for their physical encounters and that they often partied until the morning before matches. Pandya also
                made sexist remarks and has been on the receiving end of backlash. After his comments on the show,
                Pandya released a statement on social media apologising for his comments on the show.

                The incident has been condemned by their teammates in the Indian cricket team, with the BCCI having
                launched an inquiry on the two and handing them a suspension. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri has been accused of
                sexual harassment which has caused the organisation to enter a no-tolerance mode. <br><br>

                Ranveer Singh has also received stick for insensitive comments on Koffee with Karan in a previous
                season. <br><br>

                With the #MeToo movement having reached its peak in India in recent times, a growing number of women are
                coming out with their stories of sexual assault, and in light of that, Hardik Pandya’s comments on
                Koffee with Karan have without a doubt tainted his reputation permanently.
