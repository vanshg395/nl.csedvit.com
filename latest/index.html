                        possible to the lot. I know a lot of you are wondering why you were selecting considering how
                        your
                        interview went but even then, we saw a spark in you. There are going to be a million

                I think it&#39;s the right time for Year In Review for CSED. Personally for me, the most amazing
                year
                with wonderful people around. Got to learn some amazing things and had amazing experiences.
                For CSED, probably one of the most successful year of this decade. Most importantly we got
                amazing startups collaborations, we got an amazing network and chance to interact with Investors
                and mentors. We got accelerator collaboration in term of edify accelerator. Moreover, we made
                Enactus, which was an independent team under CSED in VIT, the Projects component of CSED.
                We did 3 events in 56 hours in which two of them were 24 hour event, we just did the impossible
                and I am just so proud of this team. Moreover, in my personal opinion, I haven&#39;t seen a better
                managed event than Kick Startup 3.0, and it just gives immense satisfaction to be the Organiser of
                that event. When I look at the CSED core of 2019-20, I see so much potential and healthy
                competition. I can safely say that we will be handing over the board in capable hands. <br><br>
                Let&#39;s move forward to my personal favorite, the Organising Committee, I feel organising
                committee
                is an excellent opportunity for anyone wanting to expand his or her horizons and get out of that
                comfort zone, get out of that sphere where you limit yourself due to lack of available
                opportunities.
                That one month of OC is the most productive phase of the journey. Sometime back, we released
                the OC for CSED DAY 2020. At CSED DAY, we are celebrating 10 years of CSED and to know
                more you will have to attend that. I hope it&#39;s an amazing opportunity for everyone to break the
                ice
                and experience amazing activities planned by the OC. I know that freshers won&#39;t get a better
                opportunity to get comfortable with people and settle down easily in CSED. Hope to see y’all there!

                        My journey in CSED started in the beginning of my first year itself when I volunteered for CSED.
                        I
                        remember the first volunteer meeting I attended, we were explained the Ps of marketing and asked
                        to
                        help organise StartUp Street 3.0 and Kick StartUp. This job entailed going door to door to get
                        registrations for the event. My first thought was, “Oh, this is an easy task. All you have to do
                        is
                        explain the event and that will be it.” However, the first girl I talked to, didn’t even look up
                        from
                        her laptop
                        screen while I was telling her about these events. And that was my first experience with sales.
                        However,
                        eventually I did get end up getting better at it and ended up getting registrations. <br><br>
                        The philosophy that can be applied here is that, there is something to be learnt from each and
                        every
                        experience you have. In order to have experiences, you have to push yourself to seek discomfort.
                        The
                        best way to gain confidence is to do something you’re afraid to do. Here, at CSED, you’ll be
                        thrown into
                        so many situations that will make you a better version of yourself. All you have to do is grab
                        as many
                        opportunities as you can. CSED provides a safe space for you to be experimental as even if you
                        make a
                        mistake, you’ll have plenty of chances to make amends.<br><br>
                        It’s a place where you’ll make the closest of friends, learn from both your VPs as well as each
                        other.
                        My
                        time as VP editorial has given me the pleasure of working with the greatest team anyone could
                        ever ask
                        for. There is a lot that I admire about them and witnessing them taking so many leaps forward
                        has been
                        very rewarding. This year, I’m thankful to have met these people who are extremely brilliant in
                        so many
                        ways that they make this organisation what it is. I want everyone who has joined this
                        organisation to
                        realise that it’s possible to achieve all the goals that you set for yourself if you have a
                        support
                        system. I
                        want everyone who has joined this club to realise that once you couple ambition with
                        camaraderie,
                        there is no limit to what you can achieve. <br><br>

                It makes me smile as I write this column as my I would harass other board members to submit
                their VP
                column, not knowing how hard it would be. The beginning of this year consisted of me asking my
                friends
                to write the VP column and now I finally am sitting down to write my own. My journey truly has
                come
                full circle.

                        We kicked things off strong in January by welcoming 60 new passionate
                        members at the orientation. The 2 hour event consisted of explaining the
                        objectives, vision and culture of the club. All the VPs got into the nitty-gritty
                        and gave a description of the what they do on a daily basis. The recruits even
                        got the chance to get to know each other and the club members through a series
                        of ice-breaking sessions.
                        <br><br>
                        We also held our 3<sup>rd</sup> conference in February. It was an enlightening experience
                        as the conference was filled with informative sessions and fun- filled
                        informative sessions. The February conference really cemented the culture of
                        the club and made us understand the vision and origin of the club.
                        <br><br>
                        The month of March brought in the most nerve-wracking time for the members
                        of the club as the applications for the presidential election were released. Once
                        the election process was underway, all the applicants were asked to go in
                        isolation mode. The first round consisted of a letter of intent which was
                        followed by an application round and interviews. Finally, the applicants gave
                        their presentations and let the voters make their decision. After all the votes
                        were counted, Sarthak Garg was gracefully thrown into a pool and announced
                        as the new president of CSED. After the grand election process, it was now time
                        for the board of 2019-20 to hand it over to the next batch. After a round of
                        lengthy applications and rigorous interviews, the board of 2019-20 was formed.

                April hit us with the exam season in full force. Most of our days were spent
                trying to study and binge-watching TV shows. <br><br>
                May brought in summer vacations with it, so the members of our club got busy
                with accomplishing our goals for the summer. Several members were busy
                interning at the startups that are in collaboration with us. <br><br>
                June and July stirred things up a little as the application for the organising
                committee was released. Most members of the club were enthusiastic about this
                opportunity, so a great number of applicants were
                August had us all in a frenzy as we were all busy organising scale ups and
                Saturday sessions. Along with that, we welcomed some new members in the
                family. <br><br>
                September was the most crucial month of this year as most of it was spent
                planning our flagship event and workshops. Apart from this, our annual
                conference was held in this month. The conference was filled with informative
                sessions about various arenas in entrepreneurship and activities that tested our
                negotiation and pitching skills. Needless to say, it was a roller-coaster as we had
                some fun times and some emotional times.

                determination and dedication was tested in these 56 hours. <br><br>
                November went by a little quiet as we were still getting off the high of the
                success of the events. Nevertheless, majority of our time was spent educating
                the freshers about this organisation. All the members spread the word about this
                organisation by reaching out to as many freshers as they could. <br><br>
                December was a very merry time as we held recruitments for freshers. We were
                elated to witness such a turn out. All the freshers made it extremely difficult for
                us to choose who made the final cut. We are honoured to welcome these zealous
                individuals who will decide our fate for the next year.

                Recently, Souhardyya Biswas got the opportunity to interview him. Here is how that went:
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="color: #ffffff;">
                <strong>1) What were your ambitions when you were growing up? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;I think I wanted to become a doctor. I read a book in 1990. Things which can be done using
                computers. All problems which can be solved using computers. Then I veered towards software
                engineering.&quot; <br><br>
                <strong>2) You have an experience in the field of software engineering for 15+ years, what is one piece
                    of
                    advice
                    you&#39;d like to give to the aspiring software engineers of our age? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;I would say that, when you enter the field of technology. Keep on learning about technology.
                Technology is a field that gets outdated very quickly. Keep yourself updated and gain good experience in
                this field. At one point of time, you have to become a manager and manage people. Never keep
                technology behind.&quot; <br><br>
                <strong>3) Human Computer Interaction is not a much popular subject here in India, unlike in The States,
                    being
                    an aficianado in UX and Design, what would you recommend for Computer Science students in this
                    competitive world to learn to face the competition? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;HCI is a very crucial subject in the field of technology. Whichever technology you&#39;re
                working with,
                you should learn to adapt. Be aware other than coding, think in the customer&#39;s point of view. HCI is
                used
                to enhance every product of technology. You have to think who is the main user of the product. What
                are the pains faced by the customer? <br><br>
                <strong>4) Do you believe problem solving is a talent or a skill? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;Everyone is born with problem solving skills. It is something which is inate to the human mind.
                But
                the technique to solve more and more problems, makes the mind more enhanced and skillful. <br><br>
                <strong>5) You proposed an idea where you hypothetically working for Google as a Product Manager.
                    Don&#39;t you
                    think that a huge portion of the &quot;laymen&quot; such as may I quote &quot;Writers, Fashion
                    Designers&quot; etc. may not
                    even be bothered to solve social problems using programming? Considering their appeal to solutions
                    might be dichotomical to say engineers. </strong><br>
                A) &quot;When I was speaking about laymen such as writers and fashion designers, I meant that they
                should
                be able to solve their own problems without requiring the assistance of an engineer. <br><br>
                <strong>6) Now regarding your proposed solution the CIBIL scoring system. How do you plan to get a
                    &quot;Yes&quot; from
                    other banks considering you require confidential information from them to succeed in providing a
                    customer a loan which is beneficial to you and a potential loss to the other banks? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;RBI or the Reserve Bank of India should make a software compiling data from all banks across
                India.” <br><br>
                <strong>7) As a hypothetical Amazon Product Manager you proposed that options like &quot;Frequently
                    Bought
                    Together&quot; and &quot;Special Offers&quot; should be kept in a separate page. Several customers
                    of E
                    Commerce
                    websites exist because of the exlusive offers and deals. How do you propose to market a formally
                    expensive product to a customer who can avail it at a lower price? </strong><br>

                A) &quot;OLX is an idea, where second hand products can be sold. It can a separate website where 2nd
                hand
                products are sold.&quot; <br><br>
                <strong>8) What’s the mentality that drives you to want to succeed? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;Apply the knowledge for the greater good. For example Hewlett Packard when they started off
                they
                wanted to take care of their employees. Work for the greater good. If you are solving problems money
                will come. There are 2 kinds of people, one who just want to earn money, and the other who want to do
                it for the greater good. Money will come eventually. Your work is your world.&quot; <br><br>
                <strong>9) Learning from failure is the key to success. What motivates you to keep working despite the
                    hurdles
                    in the way? </strong><br>
                A) &quot;It&#39;s always better to fail fast and keep on improving. Keep on working on the skills and
                knowledge.
                Your skills and knowledge are always for others. Think in a larger perspective. Whatever skills you have
                that is always for the others. Sometimes you fail, sometimes you pass, but always improve whatever you
                know. Think about others also. A programmer does not write codes for himself, he writes it for others.
                Someone has to work for others, or else he won&#39;t earn money. Say for instance any FMCG product,
                someone has manufactured it but he can&#39;t hold it in his factory, he will sell it off for others. It
                has to be
                used by others. Anything you can manufacture or create will be for others. &quot; <br><br>

                debt or equity ownership. They invest in the formative stages of the startup’s business and
                usually start contributing funds when the startup has something to present, such as a
                prototype of the product or service. A venture capitalist is one who is part of a limited
                partnership who is investing in the startup in the form of venture capital funds. They enter in
                the later stages of development for a portion of equity or debt ownership in an effort to
                advance the growth of the company by developing its market share.<br></p>

                attributes. Their etiology decides about the possibility of further commercialisation. <br><br>
                Chatbots take a toll from the existing jobs and replace it with an artificial simulation of high
                order intelligence. In such an approach, the upgrade connected with digital technologies becomes
                an inherent element of marketing while allowing various market players to join more naturally
                and integrally than ever before. Using chatbots in that process enables companies/brands to
                intensify consumer&#39;s diverse emotions and experiences while increasing their involvement and
                satisfaction. They become smarter and more cognitive in the space of algorithmic economy.<br><br></p>

                        alternating themselves with humans. Chatbots create an
                        environment of self-indulgence. Customers have a plethora of options to browse when they visit
                        a website. This can, however, be tedious and boring. However, bots add the secret sauce to
                        customer interaction. <br><br>
                        Chatbots use Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to gather data and insights about the
                        likings of someone. These bots then create a personalised experience and shortlist the options
                        just according to customer needs. Bots can save plenty of time by gathering information through
                        conversations rather than collecting data by monitoring user activity.</p>

                    not so useful for business. However in April

                    This announcement took the tech world and the Digital Marketing Industry by storm. Just in four

                    ChatBots (now it&#39;s 30,000 ) were developed. The reason, it was Messenger with 900 million
                    active users (now it reached 1 billion). We know what Facebook means for businesses. And the

                        that established a chatbot back in 2016. In collaboration
                        with application Kik, they created a chatbot that provides tutorials for makeup, tips, and
                        tricks
                        for skincare and reviews of the product.Researches by Martech Today show that bookings
                        through chatbot increased by 11%. As well, sales in stores have grown by the customers who

                        chatbot last year. The primary purpose of the chatbot was
                        to simplify and speed up the ordering process. Therefore, customer waiting in the queues was
                        smaller. Chatbot allowed users to order by voice messages. The best feature is that chatbots
                        remember the history of the order, so chatbot could recommend one of the previous orders.<br>

                    strengthen customer relations. It is the emergence of an era
                    where users are relying on suggestions made by the chatbots. Using chatbots on social media is
                    recommendable because of the number of users that need help. Moreover, they improve content
                    marketing because of all the information they get from the customer. Therefore, once they get
                    the information, they can personalise the messages to every customer, which will retain them.

            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">So what exactly is the lipstick effect? Well, an
                economic term attributed to evolutionary
                psychology. It is the theory that when facing an economic crisis consumers will be more
                willing to buy less costly luxury goods. For example, instead of buying expensive fur coats
                they will purchase an expensive lipstick. When the consumer trust in the economy is topsy-
                turvy, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad may have
                        been forced to withdraw the statement in
                        which he had cited that the Rs.120 crore business done by three Bollywood movies on a
                        single day to suggest strength in the fundamentals of the Indian economy, but he was actually
                        articulating a real economic phenomenon playing out in India currently. Lipstick Effect is the
                        definition of the conundrum i.e. Bollywood keeps the Box Offices well fed, whilst most
                        segments of the economy succumb to a nose-dive.</p>

            </div> <br>
            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">Well according to Robert Browning “What youth
                deemed crystal, age finds out was dew.” It
                appears in an economy in one form or the other. During an economic slowdown, consumers
                stick to favourite trusted brands, but buy less. They cut down on consumption. Media,
                entertainment, travel and leisure-linked stocks are all showing this effect, which has been
                most pronounced in multiplex stocks. Shares of PVR have risen 11.94 per cent on year-to-
                date basis till October 14, while those of Inox Leisure have gained 34.86 per cent to hover
                around their 52-week high levels. Investors are keeping a keen eye on India Inc’s September
                quarter earnings. Sectors like banking, telecom, metals, resources, IT and pharmacy have
                been signalling slower growth in recent times. Khurana of Dolat Capital, says a stock like
                Bata or quick-service restaurant chains should benefit from this effect. “Footwear as a sector
                should continue to outperform on the consumption side. Watch out for the earnings numbers
                from PVR and Jubilant,” he said.</p><br>

            <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">Movie is a small-ticket luxury in India, whilst
                travel and living are not small-ticket. Movie
                theatres are locally present, requiring less commuting cost. Hence mostly all Bollywood
                movies from Kabir Singh to Gully Boy each paced into the 100 crore club. <br><br>
                The Economist tested the lipstick effect in 2009 with statistical analysis. “Not everyone is
                convinced. Reliable historical figures on lipstick sales are hard to find, and most lipstick
                believers can only point to isolated, anecdotal examples as evidence of the larger
                phenomenon.  Data collected by Kline &amp; Company, a market-research group, show that
                lipstick sales sometimes increase during times of economic distress, but have also been
                known to grow during periods of prosperity. In other words, there is no clear correlation.” As
                a jargon in evolutionary psychology, Lipstick Effect is driven by women’s desire to attract
                mates with resources and depends on the perceived mate attraction function served by these
                products. Post 9/11, Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Estee Lauder Cos, noticed his company
                was selling more lipstick than usual. He hypothesized, that when the economy is unstable,
                sales increase as women boost their mood with inexpensive lipstick purchases instead of
                $500 sling backs. It’s not that lipsticks are inferior goods, but they are subtle indulgences and
                impactful substitutes; morale boosters like Charlie Chaplin films during the Depression. <br><br>
                So what can us as entrepreneurs do? Since this process leads to the mentality of greater value.
                Job losses, lesser salary upgrades, low business profits are the essential cause for this
                mentality. Consumers prefer brands that still are reputed, however they try to access it at a
                much lower price. They wouldn’t buy something that is considered “low quality” or “cheap”.
                That might embed a different label on their family well-being. Hence start offering value
                packs, discounts, festive deals and also budget variants which will stay strong even in the
                downfall. They should make the customers feel comfortable, and feel satisfied for catching a
                good deal. This applies to every FMCG, daily use-garments or even mobile phones. All these
                aspects of consumer behaviour highlight an imperative for marketers during these slowdown
                times. Focus on seeking out pockets of opportunity and growth for their respective products
                or services, based on sharp insights into consumer behaviour that are most relevant to their
                industry sectors. In other words, search for the lipstick effects in your respective categories.
                That’s where you are likely to strike gold. For example, in a country like India, festivals are a
                huge deal. Even throughout the economic downfall consumers will still be willing to spend
                during Diwali or Durga Puja (or any other communal festival) hence you should market your
                product to stimulate strong demand. Such festive spending would be good for consumers,
                corporates, jobs, and for the overall economy.</p><br>

                        The burning desire to achieve his/her goals, make an impact, desire to experience life to
                        the fullest and development of the self to the fullest are the fuels for their life. A flexible

                        people, unexpected and thrilling experiences, greater self-confidence are sure perks of being

                        common to all. The drive of their passion is so strong that from morning 6 to mid-night,
                        an entrepreneur manages time for everything. From family, books, stress doses, financial

                        However many of those entrepreneurs, before they made it big, have struggled through
                        moments of near-debilitating anxiety and despair, times when it seemed everything might
                        crumble. The sleepless nights, pressure to outperform the peers of the industry is surely
                        mind boggling. <br><br>
                        If you run a business, this probably all sounds familiar. It&#39;s a stressful job that can
                        create
                        emotional turbulence. Though driven and innovative, these hypomaniacs are at much
                        higher risk for depression than the general population due to very high failure rates. No
                        matter what; your psychological makeup or big setbacks in your business can knock you
                        flat. Even experienced entrepreneurs have had the rug pulled out from under them. <br><br>
                        The problem with this ‘skill’, however, is that you simultaneously cut off the other end of
                        your emotional spectrum. You naturally lose a bit of your warmth, fun and happiness
                        because you’re always in control. Feeling isolated is a natural price you pay as an
                        entrepreneur. The sooner you recognize this and do something about it, the more
                        fulfilling the role will be. <br><br>
                        Therefore, one must realise that this is an intense life with confidence, knowledge,

            <p style="text-align: justify; color: #ffffff;">
                Long gone are the days in the sports industry, where business in sports was
                confined to just selling match tickets and broadcasting the matches. The sports
                industry is evolving and with it came big names like, ’Nike’, ’Adidas’, ’Puma’
                and so much more. You might think that these brands are all revolving around
                selling sports wear and other branded merchandise. But there are other
                opportunities too in the world of Sports. <br><br>
                There are opportunities in the most unthinkable places. As was the case with
                the ‘Mud Company’. The company is known to sell the mud required to shine
                the baseball balls, prior to the start of matches. The balls are rubbed with this
                mud to ease pitchers while throwing the ball. The company caters only during
                the pre-monsoon season as the mud is best at that time. Jim Blintliff, owner of
                the Mud Company has a net worth of 200,000 USD. He makes this just by
                collecting mud, casing it and shipping it off to be rubbed on match balls! <br><br>
                Another place, Sports gives a lot of business opportunities is in Sports
                Medicine. Any one, may it be Leo Messi or Virat Kohli needs a proper
                physiotherapist and a team of doctors who can help him out with his
                difficulties off the pitch. The team of trained trainers and doctors and a gem to
                any team staff. There in lies a business opportunity to cater Gym Trainers,
                physios, Masseurs and Doctors, and cater them to any Sport team. <br><br>
                Phil Knight, the owner of Nike, in his autobiography, the Shoe Dog: A Memoir
                by the Creator of NIKE said “Life is growth, you grow or you die”. In today’s
                quick, competitive society, it holds a lot of truth. To thrive in this environment,
                entrepreneurs shouldn’t try creating a company that is competing with Nike or
                Adidas. They must start thinking out of the box. They must create an
                opportunity in a niche field. Opportunities are always out there, its you who
                must pick the ball and drive it in behind the nets before the defence catches up
                to you.

                <strong>Things you should know before starting your startup</strong><br></h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify; color: #ffffff;">
                Creating a startup is never an overnight decision. You can’t wake up one day, leave your
                normal life and take a risk like that. So many dreams and lives depend upon a business, and
                it’s no icing on a cake. <br><br>
                The chances of failure of a startup is way more than its success. In spite of the endless forfeits
                and difficulties entrepreneurs face, a staggering 84 percent of entrepreneurs would do it all
                over again. But there are a few things one must keep in mind before starting their own
                startup. <br><br>
                <strong>1. Have a strong value proposition</strong><br>
                Whatever is the idea behind your startup should be strong enough to solve a customer
                problem (or make them think you are). Develop a powerful message that potential
                customers are willing to pay for. <br><br>
                <strong>2. Fully understand the market</strong><br>
                You can have an average product, not something unique and still be successful if you
                have the right marketing skills. Knowing the depths of functioning of the market,
                watching your competitors, being aware of the customers’ opinions, etc. constitute to
                what would eventually make a good marketing scheme. <br><br>
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-7 align-self-center text-center">
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #ffffff;">

                        <strong>3. Start small and grow</strong><br>
                        Self-fund your startup, if possible and for as long as possible and then go for funding.
                        When you get funds from outside, like from investors, they own a part of your
                        product and would want to break up your product or service which will result in delay
                        in your growth. <br><br>
                        <strong>4. Surround yourself with mentors and advisors</strong><br>
                        Advisors and mentors have seen more startups fail than succeed. No one has all the
                        knowledge when it comes to any field of work. But they can surely guide you and

                        help you not make the same mistakes that they’ve seen before. An experienced guy
                        on your side will always increase your chances to succeed.

            </div>
            <p style="text-align: justify; color: #ffffff;">
                <strong>5. Be passionate</strong><br>
                Being a business founder can be very lonely and there are not enough hours in the day
                to accomplish everything. If it makes you wake up in the morning, looking forward to
                it, you are doing it right. If you’re not fuelled with passion every step of the way, this
                job will become harder and harder.
                <br><br><strong>6. Know your numbers</strong><br>
                One should always be aware of their startup costs, sales and gross margins, profits,
                specific expenditures associated with your startup. Any ignorant or wrong estimation
                may result in serious loses.
                <br><br><strong>7. There will be no entitlements</strong><br>
                When you work on startup or business, there are not enough hours in a day. A lor of
                businessmen say that it’s been years since they’ve gone on a vacation.
                Its best to accept this before you start: There will be no entitlements, you will have to
                work really hard at all times. <br><br><br>
                You can follow all these points, and your startup might still fail. It is one of the most difficult
                career paths, but if you have enough passion, you may fall a hundred times, but you will

                        <strong>Cardi B joining Fast and Furious 9</strong> <br><br>
                        Hunks and hustlers alongside strippers-turned criminals isn’t an alien concept
                        in these testosterone heavy, VFX fed, rapid action films. Cardi B has nabbed
                        yet another role, this time in the ninth instalment of the Fast and Furious
                        franchise. And yes, after Hobbs and Shaw, it is happening again. Vin Diesel
                        who plays Dominic, the ring leader of the Fast and Furious squad, announced
                        the news via his Instagram Account. <br>
                        But Cardi B isn&#39;t the only newcomer joining the team. John Cena is also
                        joining the cast, which includes Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana
                        Brewster, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, as well as Charlize Theron, Nathalie
                        Emmanuel, and Helen Mirren.

                        <strong>Hillary Clinton’s new career in comedy</strong> <br><br>
                        Hillary Clinton, erstwhile presidential
                        candidate and the person who has been living rent-free inside Trump&#39;s head
                        for at least four years is now doing comedy on the internets. Clinton took to
                        Twitter this weekend to drop a scorching parody of Trump&#39;s misbegotten letter
                        to Turkey&#39;s president and it is... definitely something! <br>
                        Would I pay good money to watch Hillary Clinton perform an evening of
                        standup? Sure. What else am I doing? Not tweeting out jokes about the
                        president anymore because, apparently, that position has been filled. Nothing
                        surprises me anymore. America is now an Outback Steakhouse: no rules, just
                        right. Hillary Clinton is shopping around a half hour network sitcom, and me?
                        I&#39;m going for a long walk in the woods of Woodstock, VIT. Let&#39;s all just live.

                        <strong>Shah Rukh Khan flatters everybody with his wit - David Letterman interview</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        3.5 billion people, probably much more is the number of people who adore the
                        ‘Baadshah’ of Bollywood. ‘My Next Guest Needs No Introduction’ a Netlfix
                        Original talk show, hosted by the famous David Letterman, invited our loved
                        superstar. With the sparkling dimples and self-deprecating jokes, Shah Rukh
                        Khan (SRK) won everybody’s hearts. The gleaming camaraderie between the
                        two was evident as an extremely frank conversation conceded. As long as
                        SRK’s glamour was admired, there were few disappointments. For example,
                        the “intro shots” for India. The clichéd Western ideas of romanticising poverty
                        still punches us in our “3 rd world nation” cheeks. The scene of David playing
                        cricket with Prithvi Shaw, a Test debut cricketer who was later handed a
                        temporary ban on doping charges, a person with a separate story of his own.
                        Treated just like a ‘prop’ for the quintessential sport of India-Cricket.

                        <strong>Deepfake</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        We have progressed far in technology. The safekeeping of a
                        personal idea is a faded idea since it&#39;s virtual inception. Deepfake is one
                        such technology which breaks the threshold of technology and privacy. In
                        1986, Jack Wodhams created the &quot;Picaper&quot;. This movie revolved around
                        skilled hackers who produce digitally enhanced videos serving
                        unscrupulous lawyers and political figures. Even 2019&#39;s BBC One drama
                        &#39;The Capture&#39; revolves around the Deepfake technology. The series
                        follows British ex-soldier Shaun Emery, who is accused of assaulting and
                        abducting his barrister. Deepfake manipulated CCTV footage is used to set
                        him up and mislead the police whilst investigating him. Google and
                        Facebook are using Deepfake troves to teach algorithms how to detect
                        them. Nowadays, the artificial intelligence and machine learning have
                        improved manifold hence stitching someone&#39;s face onto someone else is
                        easily possible. There is a huge concern that the voting in 2020 maybe
                        heavily influenced as Deepfake might be used to sway the voters.Virginia,
                        although has already made Deepfake non consensual porn illegal.

                        <strong>Donald Trump Impeachment</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Wow. It&#39;s finally there. I remember that time
                        when the whole world was shocked on his win over Hillary. Most of us
                        illiterate about the federal system of elections in the US. And 19
                        December, 2019, Donald Trump is impeached. He faces trial on the
                        charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This was the final
                        flames of the Ukraine scandal. The democrats claim that Trump abused his
                        power by coaxing Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a
                        probe against Joe Biden, the formal election candidate and Democrat
                        representative. Robert Mueller also alleged the involvement of Russia in
                        the 2016 elections. Secondly, the inquiry by the Congress in relation with
                        the impeachment of the POTUS was obstructed by the POTUS himself.
                        President Trump “has directed the unprecedented, categorical and
                        indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of
                        Representatives pursuant to his ‘sole Power of Impeachment’,” states
                        Article II. Well, Trump is not removed from office, because impeachment
                        doesn&#39;t remove the POTUS from his office. Impeachment will lead to trial.
                        After the trial, the Senators will vote on his conviction. A President can be
                        convicted and removed from office with the support of at least two-thirds
                        of the Senate.

                The presence of

                and the confidence needed to coordinate was present in his members. This is truly won because of the
                team
                effort they have shown. This is mainly for management of Kick Startup 3.0 as in that event they were at
